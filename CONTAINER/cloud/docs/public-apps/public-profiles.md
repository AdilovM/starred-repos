# Public Profiles

Serverless Cloud allows developers to share their applications built on Serverless Cloud on their public profiles. When you sign up for an account, a public serverless profile is created automatically at the URL 'cloud.serverless.com/yourUserName'. See the public profile of Serverless Inc. [here](https://cloud.serverless.com/serverless).

You can manage your public profile by adding some additional information, such as your social links and job title. To achieve this, you can visit [your organization's settings page](https://cloud.serverless.com/orgs/<yourUserName>/settings/general) on Serverless Cloud and fill out your profile. See an example public profile below.

By default, all the apps on the Serverless Cloud are created as private. You will need to make the apps public or forkable in order to share them. Follow [these docs](cloud/docs/public-apps/public-forkable-apps#making-an-app-public-or-forkable) to make your apps forkable.

If you want to work on an existing app rather than starting from templates, you can start by forking an app from a public profile. Follow [these docs](/cloud/docs/public-apps/forking-apps) to fork an app directly from a user's profile.
