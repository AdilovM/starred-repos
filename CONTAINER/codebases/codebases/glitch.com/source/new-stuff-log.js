The .env file in your project is a secure place to keep API keys or other credentials for your app. It‚Äôs only visible to you and your project collaborators, and it isn‚Äôt duplicated if someone remixes your project.

Now, the Glitch editor is introducing a brand new way to edit your .env. Never again do you need to worry about syntax mistakes causing invalid .env files, and if you miss the plaintext view it‚Äôs only a click away.

Open a project and try out the new editor!

Ever wish you could snap your fingers and turn your code into a perfectly formatted masterpiece? Click the ‚ÄúFormat This File‚Äù button (or use the handy keyboard shortcut) and we'll magically clean up your current file.

![Format your code](https://cdn.glitch.com/63b9e699-61b7-49b1-9bde-ceeaf82e3dd1%2Fformat-file-gif.gif?v=1569875695381)

Want to format just part of a file? Highlight the lines you want to format, click the button or use the shortcut, and voila! It's especially handy if you're collaborating with people in the same file and don't want to format the line they're working on.

We use the fabulous [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) library for this, and have the default options applied. Use a .prettierc [JSON configuration file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#basic-configuration) in your project if you want to set your own preferences.

Exciting news: your files and folders are now displayed in a handy, collapsible filetree.

To create a file in a folder: Click on the New File button and separate the file name with a forward slash to designate the folder - like public/my-awesome-file.js. You can also now rename and delete folders directly, which will affect all the files within them, instead of renaming all your files one-by-one.

Happy collapsing!

Not having to switch windows between your code and app makes a couple things easier:

- Teaching and Presenting

- Coding on an iPad

- And lets you use Glitch more like a a REPL on smaller projects

A new **Tools** button at the _bottom_ of the editor now contains the old 'Advanced Options' (reworked into \`Git, Import, and Export\`), as well as helpful debugging tools like \`Logs\` and \`Console\`, and infrequently-used project features like \`Custom Domains\`.
