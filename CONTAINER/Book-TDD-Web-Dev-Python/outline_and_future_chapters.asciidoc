Outline to date & future chapters plan
--------------------------------------

Thanks for reading this far!  I'd really like your input on this too:  What do
you think of the book so far, and what do you think about the topics I'm
proposing to cover in the list below?  Email me at
obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com!

NB - when I say "book" below, they're all going to be parts of this book. I
guess I should say "part" instead, but for some reason I've decided book sounds
cooler.  Like Lord of the Rings.
