Description
If your talk is accepted this will be made public and printed in the program. Should be one paragraph, maximum 400 characters.
    A beginner's introduction to testing and web development with Django. We'll build a simple web app, from scratch, but with full TDD, including functional testing with Selenium and unit testing Django's views, templates, and models. Some familiarity with Python is desirable, but no prior knowledge of Django or testing is assumed.

Audience
Who is the intended audience for your talk? (Be specific; "Python programmers" is not a good answer to this question.)
    The target is anyone interested in learning TDD, and how it is applied for a more rigorous and structured approach to web development.  It doesn't assume any prior knowledge of testing at all, or even of Django/web development. I've even had total beginners attend and enjoy it, although for them the learning curve is quite steep.  I usually ask people to pair up for the tutorial, and I tried to make sure that beginners are sat next to someone more experienced


Objectives
What will attendees get out of your talk? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?
    Attendees will get a practical, hands-on introduction to TDD and Django, including how to drive a real web browser with selenium, for functional/ end-to-end testing of test UI and user interactions, as well as how to write unit tests using Django's testing tools and the standard library's unittest.  We'll also cover the basics of django and web development, including views, templates, and the Django ORM.

Detailed Abstract

The aim is to cover the basics of setting up a simple Django site, but using full, rigorous TDD at every step along the way.

The tutorial is based on the first few chapters of my book, which is available (even for free!) online for you to follow up with after the session, so that you can embed what you've learned.  [www.obeythetestinggoat.com](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com)

We'll learn how to set up functional tests with Selenium, how to set up Django, how to run Django unit tests, how TDD actually works in practice, the unit test / code cycle where we re-run the tests after each tiny, incremental change to the code, as well as all the basics of Django like views, models and templates. We'll talk about what to test, what not to test, what the point of all this testing is anyway, and I promise to make it all at least moderately entertaining.

Plus it's all in Python 3!


Outline

* (help all the people who've, inevitably, failed to install the required software.  5-10 mins)
* Intro and welcome.  A brief TDD story.  Propose pair programming, help beginners find more experience ppl to pair with. 5-10 mins
* First FT. Selenium, django runserver. 10-15 mins
* move to unittest. 10 mins
* First django view and unit test. 20 mins
* Refactoring, using templates. 20-30 mins
* Models and the database. (whatever time is left!)


More info

*Pre-requisites!*

It is absolutely vital that you come with the required software pre-installed on your PC. It's not fair on everyone else to be sitting there while we wait for you to download stuff from PyPI over the conference network. So, make sure you have the following installed on your PC:

Python 3.4
Git
Firefox
Selenium
Django

Have a look at the preface section in my book for [detailed installation instructions](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/pr02.html#_required_software_installations), and just [email me](mailto:obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com) if you need help.

Additional notes
Other than a few minor tweaks, this would be the same tutorial as last year.  Trusty classic!
