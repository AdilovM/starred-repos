# Build faster & better with Serverless Cloud

The "cloud" is immensely powerful, but also complex and filled with lots of moving parts. Developers are now wearing more hats than ever before, not only building and designing software, but also becoming cloud architects that need to understand countless cloud services, scalable data engines, distributed systems, and so much more.

## Write code, not configuration

Serverless Cloud lets you build scalable, highly-secure, pay-per-use applications without needing a deep knowledge of cloud services. We reduce all of this complexity by interpreting your code and automatically provisioning the best possible infrastructure to support it. We also apply best practices to common use cases, removing the need for all that boilerplate and configuration, and allowing developers to do what they do best: **build software**.

## How it works

Serverless Cloud uses a combination of our [CLI](/cloud/docs/cli), [SDK (Serverless Development Kit)](/cloud/docs/apps), and [Cloud Dashboard](/cloud/docs/dashboard) to easily build, deploy, and monitor your applications.

Our lightweight **CLI** watches your local project directory and **instantaneously** syncs and deploys changes to your own fully-isolated cloud sandbox. This **personal instance** gives you a high-fidelity cloud environment to test and debug your code, all at the blazing fast speed of local development. The CLI also enables powerful workflows like generating preview builds to share with collaborators, running unit and integration test, and even deploying to production with a single command.

Writing application code with Serverless Cloud is fast and familiar. Start with our serverless version of Express.js or [BYOF (Bring Your Own Framework)](/cloud/docs/apps/frameworks) to quickly build massively scalable, globally distributed backend APIs. Want superpowers? Import the **Serverless Development Kit (SDK)** and use our intuitive interfaces to access your datastore, schedule tasks, load secrets, process events, serve static assets, and much more. No configuration and no YAMLâ€”just write code and Serverless Cloud will do the rest.

The **Serverless Cloud Dashboard** centralizes control, monitoring, and management of your applications. Automatically discover deployed routes and test them with our web-based Interact tool, access logs and metrics to monitor and troubleshoot your applications, and manage settings like secrets, access control, and more. Everything you need to build and manage amazing serverless applications, all in one place.
